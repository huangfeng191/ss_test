The specified input was Disqualified or Qualified as a possible system reference.

作为一个可能的输入源，





The fault condition must be continuously present for the Fault Delay Time (FLTDELAY) before disqualifying the input as a possible reference.
在不符合条件的输入源作为参考之前，错误情况必须是持续显示错误的延迟时间。
 After INPDISQ is set the alarm clears when the input signal is fault free for the Clear Delay Time(CLRDELAY).




The specified input port has a excessive    phase measurement     that disqualifies it from being used.

输入端口 

超过 phase 测量

从他被使用

指定的输入端口有大量phase测量，用于在检测时间内检测端口是否符合标准




Input has had excessive discontinuities.

输入信号含有大量缺失
 
This is indicated when there are more than 3 signals faults of the same type within a 5-minute window.
 
 The alarm clears when the 5- minute window contains less than 3 alarms of the same type.



 

 The specified input port’s calculated received frequency is exceeding the pull-in range of the local oscillator.
 
 
 The received signal’s calculated frequency alarmed condition disqualifies the input as a possible reference.
 
 
 After INPFRQ is set, the alarm clears when the input frequency is within the defined pull-in range limits.
